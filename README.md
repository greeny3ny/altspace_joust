# Altspace Joust
Joust Arcade Game for AltspaceVR

Work in Progress

## How to Play:
  This game requires you to be in VR with hands (Oculus Rift, Mixed Reality, Vive (maybe even NOLO???))

  - Tap the red button with your right hand to "flap" and gain height
  - Move the joystick with your left hand to move your "bird" left and right
  
  The aim of the game is to keep flapping and kill the other jousters, without being killed yourself (of course when I implement it). 

##  To Do :
 - Rescale player (player is a tad too big
 - Rescale game board (bit small)
 - Fix glitchy joystick
 - Edge looping
 - Enemies (with egg dropping)
 - Platforms
 - Some form of vague physics engine (like momentum stuff)
     - X Axis Physics (momentum on x axis... and stuff)
     - Y Axis Physics (gravity and feathery falling on player)                       - DONE!!!
     - Physics on eggs as well (when they are eventually implemented)
 - Animation on movement (specifically jumping)
 - Scoreboard
 - Scaling difficulty
 - Jousting mechanics (duuuuuuh)
 - Better machine model
 - Bird models
 - Sounds
 
 Original game is open source but written in assembly
 
 Javascript is NOT object oriented so will have to find a work around.
