# Altspace Joust
Joust Arcade Game for AltspaceVR

Work in Progress

##  To Do :
 - Rescale player (player is a tad too big
 - Rescale game board (bit small)
 - Edge looping
 - Enemies
 - Platforms
 - Some form of vague physics engine (like momentum stuff)
     - Bird will continue moving after a bit due to force etc...
     - More feathery effect on bird
 - Animation on movement (specifically jumping)
 - Scoreboard
 - Scaling difficulty
 - Jousting mechanics (duuuuuuh)
 - Better machine model
 - Bird models
 - Sounds
 
 Original game is open source but written in assembly
 
 Javascript is NOT object oriented so will have to find a work around.
