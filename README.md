# Altspace Joust
Joust Arcade Game for AltspaceVR

Work in Progress

## How to Play:
  This game is build for use in VR with hands (Oculus Rift, Mixed Reality, Vive (maybe even NOLO???))
  However, it is playable in 2D mode.

  #### Controls :
  - Small red button to start game
  - Big red button to "flap"
  - Move joystick with hands to move left/right (requires hands)
  - Orange buttons for 2D mode movement (doesn't require hands)
  
  The aim of the game is to keep flapping and kill the other jousters, without being killed yourself (of course when I implement it). 

##  To Do :
 - Rescale player (player is a tad too big
 - Fix glitchy joystick
 - Enemies (with egg dropping)
     - Enemies a WIP
     - Eggs NYI
 - Tweak physics a bit
     - Also put physics on eggs as well, with them bouncing and sliding more (when they are eventually implemented)
 - Scoreboard
 - Scaling difficulty
 - Jousting mechanics
     - Kinda there, still working on it
 - Bird models
 - Sounds
 
 Original game is open source but written in assembly
 
 Javascript is NOT object oriented so will have to find a work around.
